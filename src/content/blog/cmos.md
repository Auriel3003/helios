In the world of modern electronics, the Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology has become ubiquitous. It is a type of semiconductor technology that is used to manufacture digital logic circuits, microprocessors, memory chips, and other integrated circuits. CMOS technology has revolutionized the electronics industry and has become an essential component in the design and development of digital devices. In this blog, we will discuss the importance of CMOS technology.

## What is a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)?

A complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) is a blend of NMOS and PMOS transistors that function through the use of an applied electrical field. It was initially developed to create high-density and low-power logic gates.

MOSFET, which stands for Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors, has two types: NMOS and PMOS. CMOS transistors are utilized in a variety of applications such as logic circuits, switching circuits, amplifiers, microprocessors, integrated circuit chips, and others.

CMOS technology is essential in semiconductor technology due to its low power dissipation and low operating currents. Furthermore, manufacturing CMOS requires fewer steps compared to Bipolar Junction transistors.

## NMOS

An NMOS is constructed on a p-type substrate with n-type drain and source diffused onto it. The electrons are the dominant carriers in NMOS. If the gate is subjected to high voltage, the NMOS will conduct, and if it is subjected to low voltage, it will not conduct. NMOS is believed to be quicker than PMOS because the electrons, which are the carriers in NMOS, travel twice as fast as the holes.

## PMOS

A P-channel MOSFET is comprised of P-type Source and Drain diffused on an N-type substrate where the majority of carriers are holes. PMOS will not conduct when a high voltage is applied to the gate, but will conduct when a low voltage is applied. Compared to NMOS, PMOS devices are more resilient to noise.

## Working of CMOS

CMOS technology employs both N-type and P-type transistors to create logic functions. This enables the same signal to turn ON one type of transistor and turn OFF the other type, allowing for the use of simple switches in logic devices without the need for a pullup resistor. CMOS logic gates consist of a pull-down network of n-type MOSFETs between the output and the low-voltage power supply rail (Vss or ground), and a pull-up network of p-type MOSFETs between the output and the higher-voltage rail (Vdd). By connecting the gates of a p-type and n-type transistor to the same input, the p-type MOSFET will be ON when the n-type MOSFET is OFF, and vice-versa. The networks are designed to ensure that one is ON and the other is OFF for any input pattern.

CMOS has the least amount of power dissipation in the switching applications. It is because when one transistor is OFF, the other becomes ON. For example, if PMOS is ON, the NMOS transistor will be OFF.

The value of VDD voltage is generally selected between 5V and 15V.

The symbol of CMOS is shown below:

Here, G, S, and D specifies the Gate, Source, and Drain terminal of the NMOS and PMOS.
CMOS Logic Gates

CMOS logic gates comprise a combination of NMOS and PMOS field-effect transistors. NMOS depletion type transistors are employed as the load resistance in NMOS logic gates. In contrast, CMOS logic gates use a complementary structure where one transistor serves as the load to the other transistor.

The CMOS transistors function as positive and negative logic elements. Specifically, NMOS transistors operate as positive logic elements, while PMOS transistors act as negative logic elements. Both transistors within a CMOS device execute complementary logic functions.

## Features of CMOS Logic Gates

The features of CMOS Logic Gates are listed below:

    Reduced cost as it requires only a single power supply.
    Large logic swing.
    Large fan-out capability.
    Very high noise margin.
    Lower propagation delay
    High speed as compared to NMOS transistors.
    Lower power dissipation.
    Excellent temperature stability.
    Less packaging density.

## Types of CMOS logic gates

The Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors are categorized as:

    CMOS Inverter
    CMOS NAND
    CMOS NOR

## CMOS Inverter

The inverter circuit as shown in the figure below. It consists of PMOS and NMOS FET. The input A serves as the gate voltage for both transistors.

The NMOS transistor has input from Vss (ground) and the PMOS transistor has input from Vdd. The terminal Y is output. When a high voltage (~ Vdd) is given at input terminal (A) of the inverter, the PMOS becomes an open circuit, and NMOS switched OFF so the output will be pulled down to Vss.

## CMOS NAND Gate

The figure below displays a 2-input Complementary MOS NAND gate with two series NMOS transistors and two parallel PMOS transistors. The gate output Y is connected to Ground through two NMOS transistors and to VDD through two PMOS transistors.

When either input A or B is at logic 0, one of the NMOS transistors will be OFF, disconnecting the path from Y to Ground. However, at least one of the PMOS transistors will be ON, creating a path from Y to VDD.

Hence, the output Y will be high. If both inputs are high, both of the nMOS transistors will be ON and both of the pMOS transistors will be OFF. Hence, the output will be logic low.

## CMOS NOR Gate

The figure below illustrates a CMOS NOR gate with two inputs. The NMOS transistors are placed in parallel to pull the output to a low state when either input is high. On the other hand, the PMOS transistors are in series to pull the output to a high state only when both inputs are low. This ensures that the output is always in a defined state and never left floating. The corresponding truth table is shown below.

## CMOS Characteristics

CMOS technology is characterized by low static power consumption and high noise immunity. Unlike other logic circuits like TTL or NMOS logic, CMOS devices do not generate waste heat because they use negligible standing current even when their state doesn’t change.

This makes CMOS technology ideal for integrating high-density logic functions on an integrated circuit, and it has become the most commonly used technology in VLSI chips. The term MOS refers to the physical structure of the MOSFET, which includes a metal gate electrode on top of an oxide insulator of semiconductor material.

While aluminum was previously used as the gate material, nowadays polysilicon is used. The introduction of high-κ dielectric materials in the CMOS process has enabled the design of other metal gates.
CMOS Applications

CMOS technology has become the predominant choice for digital logic applications, largely replacing NMOS and bipolar processes. Its applications include various digital IC designs listed as follows:

· Computer memories, CPUs

· Microprocessor designs

· Flash memory chip designing

· Used to design application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)

The CMOS transistor is well-known for its efficient use of electrical power. It does not consume electrical supply when transitioning from one state to another. Additionally, the complementary semiconductors work together to prevent output voltage. As a result, this low-power design generates less heat, which has caused these transistors to replace earlier designs such as CCDs in camera sensors and be used in most current processors. The CMOS memory in a computer is a type of non-volatile RAM that stores BIOS settings and time and date information.
Advantages of CMOS

Low Power Consumption

One of the primary advantages of CMOS technology is its low power consumption. CMOS logic gates are designed to consume very little power when in a static state. This means that CMOS-based devices are highly energy-efficient and can run for extended periods without requiring a battery replacement or recharge. Additionally, the low power consumption of CMOS devices also means that they generate less heat, which is a critical factor in the design of mobile devices.

High Speed

CMOS devices are also known for their high speed. Due to their small size, CMOS transistors can switch on and off faster than other types of transistors. This high-speed operation makes CMOS-based devices ideal for use in high-speed applications such as microprocessors, memory chips, and other digital circuits.

Produces very less heat

CMOS produces significantly less heat as compared to other transistors, such as NMOS and TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic). Other transistors have some standing current even in the unchanged state, while CMOS does not have.

Temperature stability

CMOS family is stable in a wider temperature range compared to other logic circuits, such as TTL. The operating range of CMOS is around -55 degrees Celsius to 125 degrees, while TTL is 25 to 70 degrees Celsius.

Versatility

CMOS technology is also highly versatile. It can be used to manufacture a wide range of digital circuits, from simple logic gates to complex microprocessors. Additionally, CMOS technology can be used to manufacture both analog and digital circuits, making it a versatile option for many different applications.

High Noise Immunity

CMOS technology is known for its high noise immunity. The transistors used in CMOS circuits are designed to be less susceptible to noise and interference. This makes CMOS devices more reliable and less prone to errors than other types of devices.

High Speed

CMOS devices are also known for their high speed. Due to their small size, CMOS transistors can switch on and off faster than other types of transistors. This high-speed operation makes CMOS-based devices ideal for use in high-speed applications such as microprocessors, memory chips, and other digital circuits.
Disadvantages of CMOS

While CMOS technology has many advantages, it also has some disadvantages that are worth mentioning in a blog about the topic. Some of these disadvantages include:

Propagation delay

CMOS circuits have a higher propagation delay compared to other logic families such as TTL. This means that signals take longer to travel through CMOS circuits, which can impact performance in certain applications.

Complexity

CMOS circuits can be more complex to design compared to other logic families, such as TTL or RTL. This is because CMOS circuits require precise matching of transistor pairs to ensure that the circuit operates correctly.

Cost

While the cost of manufacturing CMOS circuits has decreased over time, it can still be more expensive compared to other logic families such as TTL. This is because CMOS circuits require more steps in the manufacturing process and more expensive materials.

Electrostatic discharge sensitivity

CMOS circuits can be sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD), which can damage the transistors and cause the circuit to malfunction. Special precautions must be taken during manufacturing and handling to prevent ESD damage.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the importance of CMOS technology cannot be overstated. Its low power consumption, high density, high speed, high noise immunity, ease of manufacture, and versatility make it an essential component in the design and development of modern digital devices. As technology continues to advance, CMOS technology will undoubtedly continue to play a critical role in shaping the future of electronics
