Women's safety is a topic that has been a matter of concern for many years. In recent times, there has been an increase in the number of cases of harassment and assault towards women. It is important to have technology that can empower women and provide them with a sense of security. The Woman Safety with Technology: a Smart SOS Device is a project that has been developed to address this issue.

The device is designed to be compact and easily portable. It is equipped with a push button, camera module, GPS module, and buzzer. When the push button is pressed, the device activates the camera module, captures an image, and sends it to the police station via email. The GPS module provides real-time location tracking, which can be used to track the user's movement and provide assistance if necessary.

The project uses Raspberry Pi 4B as the brain of the device, which provides powerful processing capabilities, a small form factor, and low cost, making it accessible to a wide range of users. The use of IoT technology in this project makes it possible to send images and location data in real-time.

One of the key features of the Woman Safety with Technology: a Smart SOS Device is its ease of use. The push button is designed to be easy to activate, even in stressful situations. The device can be easily carried in a pocket or purse, and its discreet design ensures that it does not draw unwanted attention.

The device has the potential to be a valuable tool for women's safety in a variety of scenarios, including personal safety, home security, and emergency response. The real-time location tracking and image capturing features of the device make it possible to provide timely assistance to women in distress.

Overall, the Woman Safety with Technology: a Smart SOS Device is a promising project that has the potential to empower women and increase their safety. As technology continues to advance, it is important to continue developing innovative solutions that can help address the issue of women's safety.
