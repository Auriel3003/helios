One example of IoT in agriculture is the use of smart irrigation systems. A smart irrigation system uses sensors to measure soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and other factors to determine the optimal amount of water required by crops. The system then delivers the precise amount of water required, reducing water waste and increasing crop yields.

In this study, we will examine the implementation of a smart irrigation system on a farm in California. The farm, which produces a variety of fruits and vegetables, had been using traditional irrigation methods for many years. However, these methods often resulted in overwatering and water waste, which increased costs and had a negative impact on the environment.
