## Introduction

- Agriculture is important for developing countries, but farmers face challenges like lack of information and low profitability.
- The Farmers Buddy app addresses these challenges using technology
- It offers information on government schemes, markets, news, and soil information.
- It helps farmers make informed decisions and improve their productivity.
- Farmers can use the app to buy and sell their crops directly, bypassing intermediaries.
- This improves their profitability and livelihoods.
- The Farmers Buddy app has the potential to transform the lives of farmers and boost the local economy.


## Need

- Agriculture is the backbone of the economy in many developing countries, and the majority of the population depends on it for their livelihood.
- Despite this, farmers in many developing countries face a number of challenges such as lack of access to critical information, poor market linkages, and limited resources.
- These challenges often result in low productivity, low income, and limited opportunities for growth and development.
- The Farmers Buddy project addresses these challenges by providing farmers with access to critical information, market linkages, and a platform to buy and sell their crops directly.
- By improving the livelihoods of farmers, the Farmers Buddy project has the potential to boost the local economy and contribute to sustainable development.
- The project also aligns with global efforts to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).


## Tools Used

- Java programming language
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Swing user interface toolkit
- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
- SQL package

## Methodology

**Requirements Gathering**

- Identify the needs of farmers and stakeholders in the agricultural industry
- Document requirements in a Requirements Specification document

**Design**

- Create a high-level architecture diagram and user interface designs
- Review and approve design with stakeholders

**Development**

- Use Java as the primary programming language
- Use JFrames, JDBC, Swing, AWT package, and SQL package to develop the system
- Conduct iterative development with regular code reviews and testing

## Methodology

- Farmers Buddy is an app for farmers to improve their livelihoods.
- The app has two components: information and marketplace sections.
- Information section provides government schemes, markets, news, and soil information.
- Marketplace section allows farmers to buy and sell crops directly, increasing profitability.
- Developed using Java, Swing and AWT for user interface.
